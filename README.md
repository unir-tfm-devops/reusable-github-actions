## üéØ Overview

This repository provides standardized, reusable components for:
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing, building, and deployment workflows
- **Infrastructure Management**: Terraform workflows for AWS and Azure
- **Container Management**: Docker build and push operations
- **Helm Chart Management**: Chart packaging and publishing
- **Java/Maven Development**: Setup and testing utilities
- **Version Management**: Automated version updates across repositories

## üîß Reusable Actions

### Maven Setup (`mvn-setup`)
Configures Java and Maven environment for Java-based projects. See [action README](.github/actions/mvn-setup/README.md) for detailed usage.

### Docker Build & Push (`docker-build-push`)
Builds Docker images and pushes them to Amazon ECR. See [action README](.github/actions/docker-build-push/README.md) for detailed usage.

### Helm Package & Push (`helm-package-push`)
Packages Helm charts and pushes them to ChartMuseum repository. See [action README](.github/actions/helm-package-push/README.md) for detailed usage.

### Version Updater (`version-updater`)
Updates application versions in workloads repositories for ArgoCD deployment. See [action README](.github/actions/version-updater/README.md) for detailed usage.

### Maven Test Reports (`mvn-failsafe-surefire-report`)
Publishes Maven test reports (Surefire and Failsafe) as comments on pull requests. See [action README](.github/actions/mvn-failsafe-surefire-report/README.md) for detailed usage.

## üîÑ Reusable Workflows

### Spring Boot CI/CD Workflows
Specialized workflows for Spring Boot applications:
- `ci-cd-release.yml`: Release pipeline for Spring Boot apps

Specialized workflows for Node.js applications:
- `ci-cd-release-nodejs.yml`: Release pipeline for Node.js apps
- `ci-cd-pr-nodejs.yml`: PR pipeline for Node.js apps
- `ci-cd-non-release-nodejs.yml`: Non-release pipeline for Node.js apps

### Terraform Workflows
Infrastructure management workflows supporting AWS and Azure:
- `terraform-apply.yml`: Applies Terraform configurations to cloud infrastructure
- `terraform-plan.yml`: Creates Terraform execution plans for review
- `terraform-destroy.yml`: Destroys Terraform-managed infrastructure

### PR Checks (`pr-checks.yml`)
